# Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge

A comprehensive recommender system project exploring different approaches to music recommendation using the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset.

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares multiple recommendation algorithms for music playlist completion, progressing from simple baselines to advanced graph-based approaches.

### Challenge Description

The goal is to recommend tracks for 10,000 incomplete playlists across 10 different challenge categories:
- Title-only predictions
- Predictions with varying numbers of seed tracks (1, 5, 10, 25, 100)
- Random vs sequential track sampling

## Technology Stack

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL â†’ Snowflake â†’ Neo4j
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Cypher
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Development**: Jupyter notebooks, pytest
